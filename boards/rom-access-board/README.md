# Virtua Racing ROM access board

This is the first board I designed for this project, and it's probably useless for SVP developers. Basically it exposes the original Virtua Racing ROM chip pins to a couple of connectors. I used these to put the ROM in an EEPROM reader and trick it into dumping the contents so I could figure out the pinout of the original chip. Not much else to it.

It was designed with KiCAD 5.1.

## License

The designs for these boards is open source and MIT-licensed. Also take into account the following conditions of use:

* Please use these tools for good. Also for fun. But good fun, not evil fun.
* Messing with real hardware is risky. By using these boards you are responsible for any potential issues you might find while using these designs.
* If you build something really cool (moderately cool also works for me) using these boards please drop a comment at `taiyou[at]gmail.com`.
* You're not forced, but if you use these boards in your own projects I'd appreciate if you could acknowledge me :).

## "Designed under the sun of Cadiz"

You'll find that most of my boards here have this text somewhere in their layout. I was born in [CÃ¡diz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1diz), the southernmost city in Spain (and the oldest city in Western Europe). It's not a city that's usually associated to technology or these kind of projects so for me it's really important that *cool* things some of us do here related to tech are considered as part of the legacy of this town too. These designs are open source so you're free to modify them at your will, but I'd ask you kindly not to remove this label if you will. Please help us to spread the name of our wonderful city all around the tech world!
